        <h1>World Championship</h1>
    <p>The League of Legends World Championship (Worlds) typically takes place between October and November each year. The exact dates vary from year to year, but the tournament typically lasts for about a month.
      The number of teams competing in Worlds has also varied over the years, but it is currently 22 teams. These teams represent the nine major regional leagues (LCK, LPL, LEC, LCS, PCS, VCS, LJL, CBLoL, and LLA) in League of Legends esports, as well as one additional team that qualifies through the Worlds Qualifying Series (WQS).</p>

    <div class="cta-content">
        <p><strong>Play-In Stage:</strong> The four runner-up teams from the major regions (LCK, LPL, LEC, and LCS) and the four winners of the minor regions (PCS, VCS, LJL, and CBLoL) compete in a best-of-one double elimination bracket to determine the final four teams that will advance to the Group Stage.</p>
        <p><strong>Group Stage:</strong> The 16 teams are divided into four groups of four teams, respectively. Each team plays a best-of-one match against every other team in their group twice. The top two teams from each group advance to the Knockout Stage.</p>        
        <p><strong>Knockout Stage:</strong> The eight remaining teams compete in a single-elimination bracket, with all matches being best-of-five. The winner of the bracket is crowned the World Champion.</p>
