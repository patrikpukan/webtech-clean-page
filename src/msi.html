    <p>
      The League of Legends Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) usually takes place between the first and second splits of all regions. The tournament typically occurs in May or June.

      The number of teams competing in the MSI has varied over the years, but it is currently 11 teams. These teams represent the nine major regional leagues (LCK, LPL, LEC, LCS, PCS, VCS, LJL, CBLoL, and LLA) in League of Legends esports.</p>

    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <div class="cta-content">
        <p><strong>Play-In Stage:</strong> The four runner-up teams from the major regions (LCK, LPL, LEC, and LCS) and the winners of the minor regions (PCS, VCS, LJL, CBLoL, and LLA) compete in a best-of-three double elimination bracket to determine the final four teams that will advance to the Rumble Stage.</p>
        <p><strong>Rumble Stage:</strong> The 11 teams are divided into two groups of five and six teams, respectively. Each team plays a best-of-one match against every other team in their group. The top four teams from each group advance to the Knockout Stage.</p>
        <p><strong>Knockout Stage:</strong> The eight remaining teams compete in a single-elimination bracket, with all matches being best-of-five. The winner of the bracket is crowned the Mid-Season Invitational champion.</p>
