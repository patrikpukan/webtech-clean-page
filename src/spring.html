            <p>The Spring split takes place between the months of January and April. The teams around the world battle in a multiple week tournament, which culminates in <strong>Spring Playoffs</strong> and then Spring Finals. The winner of Spring Finals not only gets the Spring Split Trophy, but also a direct qualification to the first international tournament of the year, the Mid Season Invitational.</p>
            <p>The regular part of the split usually consists of "Best of 1 matches", where each of the teams meets all of their opponents 2 times. After all the <em>Bo1</em>s have been played. The <strong>Playoffs</strong> begin. There, the teams are seeded into a bracket, where the first team plays a match against the worst qualified team, and so on. The matches are Best of 5.</p>
